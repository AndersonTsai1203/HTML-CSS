# HTML-CSS

## Background & Motivation

Focuses on implementing a series of basic web pages that look and behave like images and descriptions provided.

A basic capability required of someone working with user-facing interfaces is to be able to produce a web page that looks and behaves like something that has been clearly specified (e.g. an image). A common workflow within a product team may consist of a designer producing a high fidelity mock-up, which a developer will then take and use HTML/CSS to build the webpage for usage. In reality this process tends to be a bit more collaborative, and the high fidelity mockups provided are usually quite detailed and visually consist of many interact layers. However, for the sake of simplicity and fundamental knowledge we are providing flattened images with written requirements.

This focuses on demonstrating skills with HTML ("Hyper Text Markup Language") and CSS ("Cascading Style Sheets")
